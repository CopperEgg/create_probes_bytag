create_probes_bytag
=============

Ruby scripts for creating new probes, one for each system with a specified tag.
The original use case for this utility was to create a series of TCP probes to monitor the SSH port on EC2 instances, using the EC2 public hostname.

###Recent Updates

* Updated February 27, 2013 to fix compatability issues with ruby-1.8.7.
  At the same time, also added logic to update vs. create a probe.
* Updated February 27, 2013 10:30 PM CST, to fix an additional compatibility problem.
  Now the code has been verified on Ubuntu and mac osx; ruby 1.8.7 through 1.9.3, and a couple of versions of libcurl; verified to work with curl 7.22 and up.

###Synopsis
On the command line, you specify:
  - your apikey

  - the tag by which to filter your systems

  - optionally a TCP port to check on each of these servers. The default is port 22

  - optionally a checking interval, The default is 60 seconds

  - optionally one or more stations from which to send the TCP check. The default is all US stations.

The following steps will be carried out:

  - all systems with the specified tag that are currently not hidden or removed will be discovered

  - one probe will be defined for each tagged system found. Each new TCP probe will directed at the systems' EC2 public name, to the port specified.

  - each new probe will also be tagged with the same tag that you specified.

  - Once the script completes, you will see your new probes on the Probe Dashboard within seconds.

These ruby scripts and associated library scripts are based on :
* ruby-1.8.7 through ruby-1.9.3
* The CopperEgg API
* Ethon, which runs HTTP requests by cleanly encapsulating libcurl handling logic.

Testing has been done on ruby versions 1.8.7 through 1.9.3, and Ethon (0.5.9).

## Installation

###Clone this repository.

```ruby
git clone git://github.com/sjohnsoncopperegg/create_probes_bytag.git
```

###Run the Bundler

```ruby
bundle install
```

## Usage

```ruby
ruby create_probes_bytag.rb  APIKEY -t TAG -p PORT -i CHECKINTERVAL -s PROBESTATIONS
```
Substitute APIKEY with your CopperEgg User API key. Find it as follows:
Settings tab -> Personal Settings -> User API Access

Your command line will appear as follows:

```ruby
ruby create_probes_bytag.rb '1234567890123456' -t TAG
```

## Defaults and Options

The available options can be found by typing in the following on your command line
```ruby
ruby create_probes_bytag.rb -h
```

Today these options are

* -t, --tagstring [TAG]            Select Systems with this tag
* -p, --port [PORT]                TCP port to check
* -i, --interval [INTERVAL]        Check port every INTERVAL seconds
* -s, --station_list [STATIONS]    Stations from which to send TCP check
* -v, --verbose                    Run verbosely
* -h, --help                       Show this message


## A Common Use Case

```ruby
ruby create_probes_bytag.rb APIKEY -t TAG
```

This command line (with your APIKEY and the TAG that you are interested in) will create one TCP port 22 check for each tagged system.
